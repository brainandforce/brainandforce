## What's poppin'?

I'm Brandon (he/they) and I'm a solid state chemist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## My projects

### [Electrum.jl](https://githhub.com/brainandforce/Electrum.jl)

Electrum.jl is a package that provides types, functions, and other tools for working with data associated with crystal structures, including unit cell basis vectors, atomic positions, associated grids of data, and more. It provides tools such as the

### Geometric algebra

[Geometric algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra) is the study of Clifford algebras (usually real Clifford algebras equipped with various metrics) and their application to problems in ways that admit a simple geometric interpretation. One of their core strengths is that they often contain elements that behave like imaginary numbers (in that they square to â€“1) but have concrete geometric interpretations as oriented areas or elements which perform some kind of rotation.

Geometric algebras come in many flavors, including vanilla geometric algebra (VGA), a drop-in replacement for the vector algebra used throughout physics, [projective geometric algebra (PGA)](http://projectivegeometricalgebra.org/), a variant which uses a degenerent metric to model points, lines, planes, and other primitives that may be useful if you are interested in computer graphics, and conformal geometric algebra (CGA), which uses a non-positive-definite metric and supports everything supported by PGA plus circles, spheres, and more.

The broader community is based around [bivector.net](https://bivector.net) and you can find me in the forums or the Discord server, usually in physics-related discussions. I am primarily interested in the application of vanilla and projective geometric algebras to problems in solid-state chemistry, especially problems involving crystal symmetries. Secondarily, I am interested in the use of vanilla geometric algebras as a tool to provide geometric interpretations of quantum theories; in particular, providing concrete geometric interpretations for their imaginary units.

## Mechanical keyboards

While I'm not involved in any software projects for mechanical keyboards at the moment, I am an enthusiast who has way too many keyboards to deal with at the moment. If you'd like to contribute to the software side of the mechanical keyboard community, I'd strongly suggest [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/), a Bluetooth-capable firmware based on Zephyr RTOS written in part by [a friend of mine](https://github.com/nicell).
